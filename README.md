Introduction
============

nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;The external and internal qualities of calculator web application shall be covered with quality factors aspect to meet software requirements and standards. The project attempts to integrate software development process (SDLC) and testing life cycle (STLC) to ensure every single phases conducted are compliance with implicit and explicit requirements.  

nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;The software development decision framework used by this project is **Agile Software Methodology.** The mentioned methodology simplified process decisions around incremental and iterative solution delivery with continuous planning and feedbacks. Agile methodology provide flexibility on product modification and adaptivity based on defects and errors produced in each phase and quickly respond to changes.  

nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;The **Agile testing** is used to follow the principles of **Agile Software Development** with **extreme programming method Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The popularized evolutionary approach is introduced in 2003 which combines testing and development in construction phase in SDLC where we write a test case before writing production code. The behavior and functionality of single unit, module or package has to satisfy test case written with refactoring and defensive programming.  

nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;The process allow developer think through requirements and design before write functional codes, ensure every single test case and codes generated are not redundant.
